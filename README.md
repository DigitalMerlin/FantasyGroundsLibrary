  This short encounter, written for the fifth edition of the world’s most popular role playing game, can be played as a stand-alone encounter or dropped into an existing adventure or campaign. The encounter is for those playing at a beginning level and might appreciate something they can just jump into for a one or two-hour gaming session.

We’ve included a few monsters, traps and treasure to get your new characters started. The encounter also includes a map that can be used to set up your own player grid. [Download](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=18070&d=1488204990)
